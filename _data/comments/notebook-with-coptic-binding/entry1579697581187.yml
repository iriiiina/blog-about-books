message: "How's it going, cognitioliber?\r\n\r\nOK, I used to be Instagram-”big”, too.\r\n\r\nIf you are like me, you have scrolled through Instagram, wondering \"how do these friggin people get so famous\"?\r\n\r\nImagine: it is the wee hours of the morning and you told yourself you’d go for a run today.\r\n \r\nRoll over, check your phone. \r\n\r\nMake your way to Instagram. \r\n\r\nYouare flabbergastered at what you see: Over 832 likes on one of your pictures! There, you can see a a huge amount of likes on your pictures--over 832 on a single photo alone.\r\n \r\nYou rise out of the warmth of your bed, meander to the kitchen. You want a drink, so you put the kettle on for some coffee, and check Instagram again.\r\n\r\nPresto! Another 38 likes. \r\n  \r\nBuzz—a message pops into your inbox from a follower. They are asking you for advice on how you manage your food, and are congratulating you on your third month of hitting the gym.\r\n\r\nThe kettle blows and you pour your tea. When you flip out your phone, there's another message--this time from a young girl--thanking you for posting. She follows you religiously and you are an inspiration.\r\n \r\nAs you begin to respond, your cell buzzes again.\r\n\r\nHmmm, ANOTHER message. You close your phone and throw it in the bag. Time for the gym.\r\nAnyways, you get the point. This is the life of an Instagram celebrity. I should know, because I've made many of them.\r\n\r\nMy job is to take people from Instagram nobody to Insta-celebrity. (It sounds ridiculous, but results don't lie.)\r\n\r\nImagine if you raised your engagement by 100%, or 1000%?\r\n \r\nIt's not difficult to do, although almost no one does. Just hit up our website. There, you'll learn how to garner Instagram followers and likes like mad...effortlessly.\r\n\r\nOur lovely, confidential service automatically sends likes to your images a few minutes after you have posted them.\r\n\r\nWith this you have a big chance to be featured in the \"Top Post\" section.\r\n\r\nSound too good for reality? Here’s what you’ve got to do to get a taste:\r\n1. Visit https://tomm.press\r\n2. Enter in your Instagram username.\r\n3. The 3 pictures you uploaded last will get 10 - 15 likes. Just like that.\r\n\r\nHitting the Top Post page will 10X your Instafame. But you have got to do more than just want it--you've got to do something about it. Are you willing?\r\n\r\nHappy image-uploading."
